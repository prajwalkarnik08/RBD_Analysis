# RBD_Analysis
I have done the RBD (Randomized Block Design) Analysis in the excel sheets of two Crops Soyabean and Chickpea.

I have formulated the Null and Alternative hypothesis to decide whether the Treatments differ significantly (heterogeneous) or they are same (homogeneous).

In almost all the cases, the Null hypothesis is accepted i.e. the data did not provide any evidence to reject the Null Hypothesis.

When I calculated the CD and checked it against the absolute difference between the Treatment means, I got some Treatments which are differing significantly.

Finally, I have drawn conclusion by counting which Treatment is most significantly differing with other Treatment in the Significant pair of Treatments.
